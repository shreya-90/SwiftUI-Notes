SwiftUI


List (UITableView in Swift)

The job of List is to provide a scrolling table of data.
Identical to Form, except it’s used for presentation of data
rather than requesting user input.

We’ve used ForEach with ranges a lot, either hard-coded (0..<5) or relying on variable data (0 ..< students.count), and that works great because SwiftUI can identify each row uniquely based on its position in the range.

When working with an array of data, SwiftUI still needs to know how to identify
each row uniquely, so if one gets removed it can simply remove that one rather
than having to redraw the whole list. This is where the id parameter comes in,
and it works identically in both List and ForEach –
it lets us tell SwiftUI exactly what makes each item in the array unique.

eg 1:

let people = ["Finn", "Leia", "Luke", "Rey"]

    var body: some View {
        List(people, id: \.self) {
            Text($0)
      }
  }


eg 2:  List {
          ForEach(people, id: \.self) {
          Text($0)
    }
}



Loading resources from Bundle

When Xcode builds your iOS app, it creates something called a “bundle”.
if let fileURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "some-file", withExtension: "txt") {
    // we found the file in our bundle!
}

if let fileContents = try? String(contentsOf: fileURL) {
    // we loaded the file into a string!
}
