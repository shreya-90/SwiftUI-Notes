SwiftUI code nuggets


Stepper
@State private var sleepAmount = 8.0

Stepper(value: $sleepAmount,in: 4...12,step: 0.25) {
           Text("\(sleepAmount,specifier: "%g") Hrs.")
       }


//DatePicker

@State private var wakeUp = Date()
let now = Date()
 // create a second Date instance set to one day in seconds from now
let tomorrow = Date().addingTimeInterval(86400)

1.
DatePicker("Please enter a date", selection: $wakeUp)
          // .labelsHidden()

2.
DatePicker("Please enter time", selection: $wakeUp,displayedComponents: .hourAndMinute)
DatePicker("Please enter date", selection: $wakeUp,displayedComponents: .date)

3.
DatePicker("Please enter date from range", selection: $wakeUp,in : now...tomorrow)
DatePicker("Please enter date from range", selection: $wakeUp,in : now...)


///Swift gives us Date for working with dates, and that encapsulates the year, month, date, hour, minute, second, timezone, and more.
However, we don’t want to think about most of that – we want to say “give me an 8am wake up time, regardless of what day it is today.”

/*Swift has a slightly different type for that purpose, called DateComponents,
which lets us read or write specific parts of a date rather than the whole thing.*/

1. making
var components = DateComponents()
components.hour = 8
components.minute = 0
let date = Calendar.current.date(from: components)


2, reading
let components = Calendar.current.dateComponents([.hour, .minute], from: someDate)
let hour = components.hour ?? 0
let minute = components.minute ?? 0

3. formatting

let formatter = DateFormatter()
formatter.timeStyle = .short
let dateString = formatter.string(from: Date())
